Those with experience in C and Javascript will know how much of a pain in the butt typing code from scratch is. Can you image coding the same thing over and over again? With how long computer science and programming has been out, you’d think that almost anything and everything someone can think of has been programmed before. And for anything basic, you’d be right. 

Thankfully someone had the idea to create a library of sorts to call functions that will take care of some tasks for you. With the utilization of the internet, people can share code they have written and make a fellow programmer’s life easier. This consolidation of knowledge, extremely documented, and freely available over the internet for access whenever and wherever has definitely made my life easier. I can imagine it has for countless others too.

Semantic UI takes this a step further and establishes a framework to make your life even easier. This specific tool treats words and classes as interchangeable concepts for the computer to recognize. For example, in designing websites with HTML, you can have: 
```
<div class="ui three buttons">
  <button class="ui active button">One</button>
  <button class="ui button">Two</button>
  <button class="ui button">Three</button>
</div>
```
Which essentially lets you shortcut your way to creating buttons faster. 

In my experience, using Semantic UI has made my code simpler and easier to read. It’s like upgrading to a new phone, laptop, or car, once you switch, you won’t want to go back.
