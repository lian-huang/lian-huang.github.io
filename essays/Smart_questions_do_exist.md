title: Smart Questions Do Exist

Your teacher may have told you once before in the classroom that “there are no dumb questions here” to make you feel less shy to ask a question, however, in the world of coding asking a smart question will make you more likely to receive an answer. Especially if you need an answer to an extremely difficult question, whether to you or if the problem is really a difficult problem in the first place. Those with the most knowledge are also usually the busiest afterall. 

 While in your haste for answers, you may be tempted to just post a hasty question. These questions are usually not thought out and can be interpreted as being disrespectful time sinks for other developers who may be just a bit more knowledgeable. Most of the time, being able to think clearly and describe your problem and solutions you have tried will not only  make you more likely to have your questions answered, you may even end up figuring it out yourself after some thought. 

A good question will look like “JavaFX problem with zooming into the 3DShape java.lang.NullPointerException at com.sun.javafx.sg.prism.NGShape.renderContent(NGShape.java:237)”. It has both the object and the issue succinctly stated in the title. The user also gives a little disclaimer that this is the first time he is posting and describes his problem more in depth and the process, steps, and solutions he or she has tried and the result. The question also includes succinct code and a test case so the person helping can run this too. The user clearly states what he needs and all useful information so the helper can get right to the problem without spending too much time.

A bad question could look like this “A simple java program”. The title doesn’t provide much help or insight at all to what the issue is or what they would need help with. These questions would most likely immediately get discarded. 

The link to the good question is [“https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63843997/javafx-problem-with-zooming-into-the-3dshape-java-lang-nullpointerexception-at-c”]
The link to the bad question is [“https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18170990/a-simple-java-program”]
