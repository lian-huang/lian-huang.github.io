### The Great First Project
As a student in one of my first programming classes, the students were tasked with combining all the skills they had learned thus far and showcasing it in a game. In the class, we learned about variables, if statements, for loops, while loops, arrays, and objects. The language used was Java. Creating a game using java was an important leap that led me to continue taking classes in Computer Science. 

### How It Came to Be
As the project head, I had to work with my partner to decide on what genre of game we wanted to create. It had to be both simple enough that we could program it with our skills, but also crafty enough to wow the audience. The inspiration for this game came from my partner's favorite childhood song and movie, the Yellow Submarine. In our game, The Yellow Submarine, the user has to evade obstacles like moving bubbles, and collect all of the Beatles band members before time ran down. 

### Off to The Next Adventure
While we had several weeks to do this, it required constant communication between us and the professor to figure out how exactly to implement this program. At the end of the day, I had to make the final decision and coordinate with my team to make sure the program would work. Work needed to be delegated and expectations had to be communicated clearly to reduce potential headaches. While the makings of this game really tested my leadership and team player skills, but I left feeling more confident than ever that I wanted to take the next class.
