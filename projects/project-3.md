As a student in one of my first programming classes, the students were tasked with combining all the skills they had learned thus far and showcasing it in a game. In the class, we learned about variables, if statements, for loops, while loops, arrays, and objects. The language we used was Java. Creating a game using java was one of the most fun projects I’ve done so far. 

As the project head, I had to work with my partner to decide on what genre of game we wanted to create. It had to be both simple enough that we could program it with our skills, but also contain a wow factor. We determined the project would be based off of my partner’s favorite childhood song and movie, the Yellow Submarine. The Yellow Submarine had to evade obstacles such as moving bubbles, and collect all of the Beatles band members before time ran down. 

While we had several weeks to do this, it required constant communication between us and the professor to figure out how exactly to implement this program. At the end of the day, I had to make the final decision and coordinate with my team to make sure the program would work. Work needed to be delegated and expectations had to be communicated clearly to reduce potential headaches. I really learned how to be both an effective team member and a leader.
