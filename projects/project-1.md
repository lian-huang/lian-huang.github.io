During the summer of 2019, I got the chance to experience being a part of a mission-driven tech startup in Silicon Valley. The company’s mission is to provide the tools and encouragement for everyone, especially women and minorities, to negotiate their compensation packages. Riva would use machine learning to generate the most compatible response to help one negotiate their wage. As a startup in the pre-seed stage of funding, the company only had a handful of people on the team and needed much more to accomplish all of its goals. 

As the organization was focused on helping women and minorities, they needed someone to search for organizations that were focused on these groups to find people who would use the service. This is where I came into use and spent weeks digging through local organizations, university organizations, and national chapters’ websites, facebook groups, and directories to look for a point of contact that would result in the highest rate of response. I was also involved with reworking the emails, using my business writing background, to increase the rate of success. 

While these tasks did not require a highly skilled person to execute them, I picked up a lot by physically being in the workspace and experiencing the culture. Working on the mainland, and particularly in San Francisco, is very different from the slow-pace and laid back atmosphere here in Hawaii. However, I was able to talk to my co-workers, who were mainly software engineers, and network with other professionals working in the tech industry. I gained insight on the life of a data scientist working at Uber and an analyst working at Google and got to meet great friends from another part of the world.
