As a local small business located in the heart of Kakaako, Lucy’s Lab and Creamery, serves delicious handmade ice-cream in a variety of fun flavors. It really is like a lab, but just like many other small businesses, this company was struggling to stay afloat. It did not have the energy or resources under the current management to create other streams of income or fully pivot. Strapped with just a little over two years left of the lease, the owner sought out different organizations and groups that would be willing to take over in a bid to provide other students a learning opportunity on running a business and maybe even turn it around. One thing led to another and we, the Hawaii Student Entrepreneurs, a student organization under the Shidler College of Business, ended up taking it over.

Running a small business takes a lot of time and effort. Similar to a larger corporation, a small business needs a leader to guide the company and make the final decisions, an operations department to make sure the day-to-day tasks are taken care of, a marketing department to drive demand, and a finance department to make sure the company has the funds to keep going. My role as the Chief Finance Officer is to gather data, monitor the current state of the business, and create reports to communicate our financial health and pinpoint areas of concern. As the first Chief Finance Officer for Lucy's, I am also creating the groundwork for future CFO's to understand the company's financial past, the current state of the business, and where it is headed as efficiently as possible.  

While this job does require business background, I was also able to use the knowledge I had gained from taking a machine learning class as well as a data mining and visualization class to create my models to forecast demand and pinpoint inefficiencies. In academia, without harsh deadlines, one can take as long of a time as they need to gather information and create their models using the most fanciest of techniques, but in a rapidly changing environment where decisions need to be made as soon as possible, it is more commonplace to see one using shortcuts and tricks to find information as efficiently as possible. The phrase “Perfect is great, but done is better” doesn't come more true in this scenario.
