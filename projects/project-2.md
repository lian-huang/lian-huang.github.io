As a local small business located in the heart of Kakaako, Lucy’s Lab and Creamery, serves delicious handmade ice-cream in a variety of funky flavors. It really is like a lab. But just like many other small businesses, the company was struggling to stay afloat and did not have the resources to pivot to anything else. The owner came to us at Hawaii Student Entrepreneurs, a student organization under the Shidler College of Business, to find a team of students willing to take it over.

Running a small business takes a lot of effort. Similar to a larger corporation, a small business needs a leader to guide the company and make the final decisions, an operations department to make sure the day-to-day tasks are taken care of, a marketing department to get customers, and a finance department to make sure the company has the funds to keep going. My role as the Chief Finance Officer is to gather data, make reports to show the current state of the business, and create models of different scenarios to help meet our goals. 

While this job does a business background, I was also able to use the knowledge I had gained from taking a machine learning class as well as a data mining and visualization class to create my models. In academia, without harsh deadlines, one can take as long of a time as they need to gather information and create their models using the most fanciest of techniques, but in a rapidly changing environment where decisions need to be made as soon as possible, it is more commonplace to see one finding shortcuts and tricks find information as efficient as possible. The phrase “Perfect is great, but done is better” has never rang more true.
